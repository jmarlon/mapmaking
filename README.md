This repository contains:
- this README file
- two R scripts
- two datasets
- one crosswalk file (csv)

Following are instructions to:

1) produce a dataset for mapping in a tool such as Datawrapper.  
2) produce a choropleth map in R.

The first script produces a dataset for mapping but does not produce the actual map. Rather, it creates a spreadsheet (csv) with county-level percentages of African American populations from 2020 census data. This data can be imported into Datawrapper (or R) to create choropleth maps.

The second R script produces a choropleth map of perceived flood risks from survey data. It uses the sf or simple features package to prepare and construct the map.
