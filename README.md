# mapmaking

This repository contains:
1) an example script that produces a choropleth map from some survey data. It uses the sf or simple features package to prepare and construct the map.
2) a script that produces county-level percentages of African American populations from 2020 census data. This data could be used in Datawrapper (or R) to create choropleth maps.
